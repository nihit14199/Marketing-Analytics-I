This repository is my original work for Marketing Analytics-I coursework from my master's degree in Marketing (focus: data analytics) at McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin from 2021-22. It includes the important projects & assignment of the coursework I have taken and some of the individual projects I have worked upon during this class.
